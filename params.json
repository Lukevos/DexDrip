{"name":"Dexdrip","tagline":"Android Application that collects dexcom signals over BLE and allows calibrations","body":"### DexDrip\r\nThis is my DexDrip Project page! Its used to catch raw transmissions from your Dexcom transmitter and then, using a calibration algorithm written by me (as in, you shouldn't trust it) give you a nice realtime graph of your BG levels.\r\n\r\n### ITS A WORK IN PROGGRESS\r\n* There are no notifications\r\n* There is no uploading\r\n* There is very little error handling\r\n* There is bad behavior around slope generation after missed readings\r\n* Im not even beginning to use the filtered data for error handling yet\r\n* It has NOT been tested on the first few days of a sensor so it will likely be WAY OFF\r\n\r\n\r\n### Q and A time:\r\n##### Should I trust any of the information DexDrip shows me?\r\nNO!!!\r\n\r\n##### Should I make any decisions based off of what DexDrip shows me?\r\nNO!!!\r\n\r\n##### Should I stop carrying around my Dexcom receiver?\r\nNO!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Recap:\r\nDont trust it, its a proof of concept, it may as well be making up silly numbers with a random number generator.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Got it? Cool\r\n* What you will need & Diagrams\r\n* My Current Wixel code\r\n* Android code","google":"UA-57122501-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
